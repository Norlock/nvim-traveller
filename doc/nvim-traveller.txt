Nvim-traveller - *traveller*

A file manager made for multiproject purpose, so you don't have to close your neovim instance. 

Problem:
1 - 
You are working on a project with a frontend and backed. You find out that you
need an extra field in your api call response, what do you do? Most people will
open another terminal or tmux window and (cd/fzf/z) to the directory they need
to go. Than they open neovim with the name of the file. 

Already you are spending mental capacity trying to navigate to that other
project. You also can't use the buffer of each other session (unless you use
something like nvr), if you just for example want to copy some fields or
function names.

2 - 
You navigated to some directory and realised you want to tail the log file
there. Opening a terminal and jump towards the same directory is taking time and
mental resources.

Solution:
Use the telescope directory search customization by Nvim-traveller. Open the
terminal (=) or press f/a to start the fuzzy search. Nvim-traveller will
automatically update cwd to the current file, so all your plugins work.

Help - *traveller-help*

To see help press "?" after openning the navigation buffer.
